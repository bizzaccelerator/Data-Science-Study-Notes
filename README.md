# Data Science Study Notes
These are the study notes I've taken during my self thaught path as a Data Scientist.

I've divided my notes in the form of chapters that anyone can follow to learn data science faster than I did. All chapters begin with a introduction to the subject, and are closed with conclusions and further readings suggested.
