    "\n",
    "Python has several features that make it well suited for learning (and doing) data science:\n",
    "- It 's open source, which means it is free.\n",
    "- It works similarly in most applications, so it’s a predictable language which make it desirable in programming.\n",
    "- It’s relatively simple to write and to maintain (and, in particular, to understand). Due to its pragmatism it is widely accepted by programmers. \n",
    "- It’s useful in many applications. It’s been designed as a general-purpose programming language, then it can cooperate with a variety of other software components, making it the right language for gluing together code written in other languages.\n",
    "- It’s simpler, faster to process (both for humans and for tools). This is a very high-level language (VHLL), that affords high programmer productivity, making Python a strong development tool.\n",
    "- It’s an object-oriented programming language that allows you some functional programming procedural style too. \n",
    "- It has lots of useful data science–related libraries. \n"

    "It is important to differentiate the Python implementation from the language itself. The language implementation is a system for executing the computer programs, and Python uses the _interpretation approach_, where the program is read as input by an interpreter, which performs the actions written in the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this writing, the __Classic Python__ - also known as CPython, and often known as just Python - is the most up-to-date, solid and complete production-quality implementation of the language. CPython is a bytecode compiler, interpreter, and set of built-in and optional modules, all coded in standard C. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting implementation of CPython is IPython, which enhances CPython interactive interpreter to make it more powerful and convenient. IPython has been refactored, now morphed into __*Jupyter Notebooks*__, an interactive programming environment that, among snippets of code, also lets you embed commentary in literate programming style and show the output of executing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is more to Python programming than just the language. There are plenty of libraries and extensions that suit almost any application. Most of the modules are fully functional in different versions of Python, and let code access functionality supplied by the underlying operating system or other software components such as graphical user interfaces (GUI’s), databases, and networks.Extensions also afford great speed in computationally intensive tasks such as XML parsing and numeric array computations, which is specially suitable for Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being proficient in Python up to a fluent software developer standar is not needed to process data successfully. To be a high performer Data Scientist / Data Analyst, it’s recommended to get a solid foundation of the basis, understood as the lexical structure, data types, variables, and control flow statements and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of Python I recommend the most is Anaconda. This distribution package compiles the Python standard libraries, some external extensions and the IPython implementation, so you are ready to tackle data analysis tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "When doing data science with Python, your code is expected to be written in a _Pythonic way_, meaning it should be concise and efficient. Pythonic code is often associated with the use of list comprehensions, which are ways to implement useful data processing functionality with a single line of code.\n"
